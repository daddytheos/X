The film inspires itself from a true incident happened in 1912 with a grand ship named RMS Titanic. The film follows a story of Rose DeWitt Bukator (Kate Winslet) who is a well brought up girl belonging from a wealthy family engaged to a business conglomerate named Nathan Hockley. She feels like she is stuck in the middle of nowhere where her freedom is challenged and while trying to jump of the Railing because of her sorrows one night she meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is just a normal guy. He does not have a slightest clue of where he will be winding up on the next day with his art of Drawing Portraits. They both immensely attract each other. How this love will reach its heaven while fighting with the grudges from the opposers... Titanic is technically a well made movie. It carries all the emotional bond that mainly carries a human being. The love between Rose and Jack, the despair caused to all the crew and remaining passengers, the band that played till the very last end. This makes the movie immensely emotionally captivating. - 8/10')">Titanic (1997)</a></li>
